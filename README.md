# Renderer

Renderer following: https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki

# Purpose

To learn how to render stuff.

# Win32?

Yes.

ssloy/tinyrenderer utilizes the TGAImage format distributing a header/src file pair. But I wanted to see it running from a window instead of just writing to a file.

So I'm using the win32 API's to handle all of the window creation and pixel blitting.

# Re-inventing the Wheel

I don't like using tools I don't really understand. So where I feel it's reasonable, I'm building my own data structures and such.
